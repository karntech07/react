# Whenever we iterate through list, we should give key. This key should be unique. we can give index but we should avoid it. Give index only if we dont have any unique key

export const ProductContainer = () => {
    return (
        <div className="body">
            {
                productsList.map((product, index) => <Product  key={product.id} productData={product}/>)
            }
        </div>

# Config driven UI
Controls UI based on data coming from server. Like showing discount offers on zomato or swiggy. Its based on loaction. Like showing color on card or anything.

# Too much use of map, filter and reduce.

# Passing props to functional component is like passing arguments to function
