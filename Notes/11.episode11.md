# Higher order components
It is a function which takes component as an input and returns component. It just enhances the function

# Higher order function is a pure function.

# react dev tools extension (components and profiler explore)

# lifting state up

# controlled components
If parent components controls the child component whether we have to show child component or not by sending some kind of flag or something is called controlled components otherwise it is called uncontrolled components.

# lifting state up study and implement
Do accordian feature by own


# props drilling
In react , we pass data from parent to child. A -> B -> C, suppose we have to pass data from A to C, so first we have to pass from A to B then B will pass to C. Consider of many nested components, this passing of data is not a good option. It is called props drilling.For 2-3 level is ok.

To get rid of props drilling, we use react context variables
 study react context createContext
